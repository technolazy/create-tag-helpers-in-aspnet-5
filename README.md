# [Create Custom Tag Helpers in ASP.NET 5][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Tag Helpers are a new feature introduced in ASP.NET 5 which let us generate HTML dynamically. Tag Helpers are added to an ASP.NET view using an HTML-like syntax, which is then transformed by a C# class. This gives developers a natural syntax for reusing common HTML components. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremey McPeak will teach you all about Tag Helpers. You'll learn how they are different from previous C# Razor syntax, and how to use them in your applications. Most importantly though, you'll learn how to write your own custom Tag Helpers to make reusable HTML components.
